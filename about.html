        <p width="50%">I am a computer science major and this website is a project of my CSC-106 programming course.  It is very basic.  I am a freshman here at URI and I have
                   a dog named Louis(seen on the left).  In my free time I enjoy working out, longboarding, and hiking.  Here is a picture of the type of longboard I own(seen on the right).  I enjoy playing video games such as moba's and story games,
                    but the majority of games I play are fps games.  Last but not least, I put a picture of my friend group as a big picture at the bottom as they are a big part of my life.
                    This project was extremely challenging and took me a lot more hours than I would care to admit
                    but now I am finally done. I am the type of person who is a perfectionist so although times were definetly stressful while making this project
                    I had a lot of fun messing around and playing with a lot of the elements.</p>
