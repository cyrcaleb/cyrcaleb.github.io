            <p width="50%">Overall, social media is detrimental to the health of young adults because it is too difficult to detach from, causes them to develop FOMO, and causes short term memory problems.  Since kids these days grow up with social media, it becomes a standard to almost constantly be on it which leads to the inability to break away from it.  As previously mentioned, social media itself is very harmful because the content it provides leads to serious problems such as depression and anxiety.  Furthermore, FOMO, the fear of missing out, is also derived from social media when they see other people on the platform, regardless of whether they know them or not, doing or experiencing things without them.  Lastly, since the majority of the information being perceived from social media is not vital, the brain gets rewired to forget these short term memories faster.  This ultimately leads to a very poor short term memory problem.  </p>

            <p width="50%">With all this bad news about social media it may seem like the best solution is to get rid of it entirely.  However, social media does have its advantages, such as its ability to spread awareness to the world about important topics and issues.  Moreover, social media makes it easier for campaigns and fundraisers to take off simply due to convenience and mass media traction.  If one is able to understand how social media is affecting them, ensure that they are in control of it and not the other way around, and be aware of many of the scams and security issues that come with this tool.  Then they can use it as just that, a tool.  A tool that allows them to find general information, connect with others, and make the world a better place.  Just like many appliances and machinery in the real world, if you do not know how to use it correctly, it can end up injuring you which is why we all need to be aware and safe when it comes to social media.
