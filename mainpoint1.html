            <p width="50%">The tendency of the fear of missing out (FOMO) in young adults emerged alongside the rise of social media, also the unrealistic expectations that social media presents to students and young adults.  FOMO might make you believe that your friends are living more interesting or happy lives than you are. It's frequent among college students, especially when they don't have plans but see all of their pals blogging about how amazing they are. According to CNN Student News “FOMO has become a bigger concern for younger people these days than before. FOMO is experienced by 56% of social media users and 69% of millennials.” When people see other social media users' highlight reels, they frequently experience FOMO. They become anxious when they learn that others are having rewarding experiences without them. Browsing social media prepares a person for FOMO, even if social media isn't the main cause of FOMO. 
It is hard to detach yourself from something that has been a part of your life for many years and that has that amount of control. People go on social media for many different reasons so if you take away social media it may affect the person depending on what they used social media for. For example promotion, many people use social media to promote their work or themselves and detaching social media will allow people to lose out of income and fall into depression or anxiety. Detaching yourself from social media may have benefits or it may not depending on how you see it. It can cause less anxiety if it causes you anxiety or it can possibly benefit you in ways such as gaining a following or gaining more income. Social media can help build you up or break you down, it's up to you to fix.
