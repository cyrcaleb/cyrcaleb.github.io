            <p width="50%">Social media is an outlet where we can gain knowledge about sports, news, and just what is going on in our society. Social media comes in the form of instagram, twitter, facebook etc. Social media has a strong effect, and pulls on college students which usually range from  18-22yrs of age. In the long term social media can affect college students in various ways such as making them lazy which can also lead to time management issues, it can make them feel insecure about themselves. In the long term social media can cause students to have anxiety. Students go on social media and see people with this lifestyle that someday they maybe want to live.  It can cause them to feel anxious and wonder if there is something wrong with my life. Social media is a tool that in that long term will have effects because of the time you spent on it.  In a short term aspect social media can cause you to procrastinate, and not focus on your responsibilities. This is the power that social media has and can control your everyday life.</p>

        <h1>Spreading Awareness </h1>
            </center>
        <div>
            <p width="50%">To be able to fix this issue you are going to have to confront it and spread awareness for the issue at hand. Spreading awareness to mental health is important because when it comes down to it you may be saving someone's life. We have seen and experienced students who have gone into a state of depression and anxiety because their main focus and attention is on other peoples life on social media and not figuring out how maybe they can improve or get some motivation for their lives. Social media tends to make you want to live someone else's life. That is something you should have a mindset of especially as an 18 year old or 22 year old trying to start your own life, and make it on your own.</p>
