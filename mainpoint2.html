            <p width="50%">Social media is an outlet where we can gain knowledge about sports, news, and just what is going on in our society. Social media comes in the form of Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, etc. Social media has a strong effect and pulls on college students which usually range from  18-22yrs of age. In the long term, social media can affect college students in various ways such as making them lazy which can also lead to time management issues, it can make them feel insecure about themselves. In the long term, social media can cause students to have anxiety. Students go on social media and see people with this lifestyle that someday they maybe want to live.  It can cause them to feel anxious and wonder if there is something wrong with their life. Social media is a tool that in the long term will have effects because of the time you spent on it.  In the short term aspect, social media can cause you to procrastinate, and not focus on your responsibilities. This is the power that social media has and can control your everyday life.</p>

        <h1>Confronting The Problem</h1>
            </center>
        <div>
            <p width="50%">To be able to fix this issue you are going to have to confront it and spread awareness of the issue at hand. Spreading awareness of mental health is important because when it comes down to it you may be saving someone's life. We have seen and experienced students who have gone into a state of depression and anxiety because their main focus and attention is on other people's lives on social media and not figuring out how maybe they can improve or get some motivation for their lives. Social media tends to make you want to live someone else's life. That is something you should have a mindset of especially as an 18-year-old or 22-year-old trying to start your own life and make it on your own.  It is hard to detach yourself from something that has been a part of your life for many years and that has that amount of control. People go on social media for many different reasons so if you take away social media it may affect the person depending on what they used social media for. Detaching yourself from social media will benefit you in the long run if it is something you do not currently have control over. It can cause less anxiety or it can benefit you in ways such as gaining a following or gaining more income by putting more focus into building yourself. Social media can help build you up or break you down, it's up to you to fix.</p>
