            <p width="50%">It is hard to detach yourself from something that has been a part of your life for many years and that has that amount of control. People go on social media for many different reasons so if you take away social media it may affect the person depending on what they used social media for. For example promotion, many people use social media to promote their work or themselves and detaching social media will allow people to lose out of income and fall into depression or anxiety. Detaching yourself from social media may have benefits or it may not depending on how you see it. It can cause less anxiety if it causes you anxiety or it can possible benefit you in ways such as gaining a following or gaining more income. Social media can help build you up or break you down, its up to you to fix.</p>

            </center>
        <div>
            <p width="50%">To be able to fix this issue you are going to have to confront it and spread awareness for the issue at hand. Spreading awareness to mental health is important because when it comes down to it you may be saving someone's life. We have seen and experienced students who have gone into a state of depression and anxiety because their main focus and attention is on other peoples life on social media and not figuring out how maybe they can improve or get some motivation for their lives. Social media tends to make you want to live someone else's life. That is something you should have a mindset of especially as an 18 year old or 22 year old trying to start your own life, and make it on your own.</p>
