            <p width="50%">As many adolescents develop an addiction to social media, they become so consumed with always needing to be on social media that they are forced to multi-task. Multi-tasking has led to more than just an extra distraction, but a short-term memory problem. Students are not able to remember information as successfully after using social media rather than when they don’t. This just shows another negative aspect that social media brings to a student’s life as they are becoming dependent on social media rather than solely focusing on their academics.</p>

            <p width="50%">One such impact, perhaps less commonly discussed, is the media's effect on human memory and how this affects the way we recall history. People's feelings regarding their memories could be influenced by social media. In the classroom, students are using their phones constantly, with or without the permission of the teacher. This is leading to a major distraction, especially during test-taking, quizzes, or other assignments. Students are more focused on their phones and what might be going on in the social media world rather than what is right in front of them. More specifically, a study was conducted and clearly showed that students who use their phones constantly have been receiving lower scores than the ones who don’t. Also, media engagement impacts how we form relationships with strangers to how we experience life as a whole. Many times, students have important encounters with classmates, teachers, and friends that they sometimes forget because they are too immersed in the social media world. Ultimately, the overuse of social media in the classroom has led to a major distraction affecting the short-term memory of students as they attempt to pursue their academic goals. </p>
