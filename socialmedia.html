            <p width="50%">Social media is something we all know and love but is causing a mental downfall for many college students and adolescents. 
                Silently, the mental health of students is plummeting faster than ever before. Throughout the pandemic, many students who were forced 
                into quarantine were ultimately left to go on social media a lot more than usual. This caused the already growing problem to explode. 
                As everyone is stuck inside, the celebrities that are still living their unrealistic lives cause all the adolescents to believe that 
                they aren’t living up to the new standard. Evidence of this change is shown in the spike in suicide rates during that time. Mental 
                health is a serious issue that many are afraid of talking about in general, but even more, now that cyberbullying is easier on social media.</p>

            <p width="50%">What we cannot argue are the effects that social media has on college students. Students struggle with social media because 
                they look at it, and see athletes or models and want to live that type of lifestyle. The money they spend the attention they get, and 
                people want that. This can lead to depression and anxiety. College students go to college to be something in life. They ultimately 
                want to leave college and make life-changing money. They see the athletes and what we would consider popular figures living that 
                lifestyle that they can only dream of.  The danger that social media has one student's mental health has effects on people of the age 
                range of 18-22, which are college students. People are aware of mental health, but many are not aware of what causes it. Social media. 
                Social media has many effects on college students such as a detriment to one’s mental health, a distraction due to fear of missing out, and 
                an effect on a student’s memory.
