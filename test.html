        <p width="50%">This Webpage has a collection of programs that I wrote in my CSC106 course at the University of Rhode Island.<br>  It is a very fun and rewarding project.  
            In this project we use hyperlinks to connect images, that act as buttons, to separte webpages that we have also created.<br>
                I have lots to learn in the future but this project was a lot of fun and I can't wait to learn whats next.</p>
